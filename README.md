# falconos

falconos (fal-coh-nos) is a hobby OS I'm using to learn and experiment with.  It's mainly used to follow tutorials I find online and mess around with ideas before I try to implement it "better" in aphOS. A lot of code and ideas will come from the places listed below.

Here's a mockup that was commissioned for me and is my target for the falconos GUI:
